# data struture
# diffferent types of datastruture

# two different types of datastruture

# 1)Liner datastruture
# elements are stored in consecutive location
# stack
# array=[10,20,30]elements are stored in consecutive location
# queue

# 2)non lineardatastuture
# elements are not stored in consecutive location
# linkedlist
# node[data,next adress of b]--->[data,next]
# node[data 10,next adress of b]--->[data,nextaddress of c]
# a---------------------------------------------b

# binary searchtree

# [20,18,17,19,25,23,24]
#     tree(root,left,right)
# graph
